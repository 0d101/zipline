    Reference loader for

    Does not currently support adjustments to the dates of known earnings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    all_dates : pd.DatetimeIndex
        Index of dates for which we can serve queries.
    announcement_dates : dict[int -> pd.Series or pd.DatetimeIndex]
        Dict mapping sids to objects representing dates on which earnings
        occurred.

        If a dict value is a Series, it's interpreted as a mapping from the
        date on which we learned an announcement was coming to the date on
        which the announcement was made.

        If a dict value is a DatetimeIndex, it's interpreted as just containing
        the dates that announcements were made, and we assume we knew about the
        announcement on all prior dates.  This mode is only supported if
        ``infer_timestamp`` is explicitly passed as a truthy value.

    infer_timestamps : bool, optional
        Whether to allow passing ``DatetimeIndex`` values in
