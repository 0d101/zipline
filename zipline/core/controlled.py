"""
Poller logic for a component which is controlled by the monitor, this is
largely universal and thus we break it out into a seperate module and
splice it into the dispatch loops for each component instance.

Example usage::

    def do_work():
        socks = self.poll.poll()

        # Handle control events
        do_handle_control_events()

        # Handle other events
        if socks.get(socket) == zmq.POLLIN:
            ...
