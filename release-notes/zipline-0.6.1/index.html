<h1 id="zipline-061-release-notes">Zipline 0.6.1 Release Notes</h1>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major fixes to risk calculations, see BUG section.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Port of <code>history()</code> function, see ENH section</strong></li>
<li><strong>Start of support for Quantopian algorithm script-syntax, see ENH section.</strong></li>
<li><strong>conda package manager support, see BLD section.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enhancements-enh">Enhancements (ENH)</h2>
<h3 id="always-process-new-orders">Always process new orders.</h3>
<p>i.e. on bars where <code>handle_data</code> isn't called, but there is 'clock' data e.g. a
consistent benchmark, process orders.</p>
<h3 id="empty-positions-are-now-filtered-from-the-portfolio-container">Empty positions are now filtered from the portfolio container.</h3>
<p>To help prevent algorithms from operating on positions that are not in the
existing universe of stocks.</p>
<p>Formerly, iterating over positions would return positions for stocks which had
zero shares held. (Where an explicit check in algorithm code for <code>pos.amount !=
0</code> could prevent from using a non-existent position.)</p>
<h3 id="add-trading-calendar-for-bmfbovespa">Add trading calendar for BMF&amp;Bovespa.</h3>
<h3 id="add-beginning-of-algo-script-support">Add beginning of algo script support.</h3>
<p>Starts on the path of parity with the script syntax in Quantopian's IDE on
<a href="https://quantopian.com">https://quantopian.com</a></p>
<p>Example:
    from datetime import datetime
    import pytz</p>
<pre><code>from zipline import TradingAlgorithm
from zipline.utils.factory import load_from_yahoo

from zipline.api import order

def initialize(context):
    context.test = 10

def handle_date(context, data):
    order('AAPL', 10)
    print(context.test)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import pylab as pl
    start = datetime(2008, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, pytz.utc)
    end = datetime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, pytz.utc)
    data = load_from_yahoo(
        stocks=['AAPL'],
        indexes={},
        start=start,
        end=end)
    data = data.dropna()
    algo = TradingAlgorithm(
        initialize=initialize,
        handle_data=handle_date)
    results = algo.run(data)
    results.portfolio_value.plot()
    pl.show()
</code></pre>
<h3 id="add-hdf5-and-csv-sources">Add HDF5 and CSV sources.</h3>
<h3 id="limit-handle_data-to-times-with-market-data">Limit <code>handle_data</code> to times with market data.</h3>
<p>To prevent cases where custom data types had unaligned timestamps, only call
<code>handle_data</code> when market data passes through.</p>
<p>Custom data that comes before market data will still update the data bar. But
the handling of that data will only be done when there is actionable market
data.</p>
<h3 id="extended-commission-pershare-method-to-allow-a-minimum-cost-per-trade">Extended commission PerShare method to allow a minimum cost per trade.</h3>
<h3 id="add-symbol-api-function">Add symbol api function</h3>
<p>A <code>symbol()</code> lookup feature was added to Quantopian. By adding the same API
function to zipline we can make copy&amp;pasting of a Zipline algo to Quantopian
easier.</p>
<h3 id="add-simulated-random-trade-source">Add simulated random trade source.</h3>
<p>Added a new data source that emits events with certain user-specified
frequency (minute or daily).</p>
<p>This allows users to backtest and debug an algorithm in minute mode to
provide a cleaner path towards Quantopian.</p>
<h3 id="remove-dependency-on-benchmark-for-trading-day-calendar">Remove dependency on benchmark for trading day calendar.</h3>
<p>Instead of the benchmarks' index, the trading calendar is now used to populate
the environment's trading days.</p>
<p>Remove <code>extra_date</code> field, since unlike the benchmarks list, the trading
calendar can generate future dates, so dates for current day trading do not need
to be appended.</p>
<p>Motivations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The source for the open and close/early close calendar and the trading day
  calendar is now the same, which should help prevent potential issues due to
  misalignment.</li>
<li>Allows configurations where the benchmark is provided as a generator based
  data source to need to supply a second benchmark list just to populate dates.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="port-history-api-method-from-quantopian">Port <code>history()</code> API method from Quantopian.</h3>
<p>Opens the core of the <code>history()</code> function that was previously only available on
the Quantopian platform.</p>
<p>The history method is analoguous to the <code>batch_transform</code> function/decorator,
but with a hopefully more precise specification of the frequency and period of
the previous bar data that is captured.</p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre><code>from zipline.api import history, add_history

def initialize(context):
    add_history(bar_count=2, frequency='1d', field='price')

def handle_data(context, data):
    prices = history(bar_count=2, frequency='1d', field='price')
    context.last_prices = prices
</code></pre>
<p>N.B. this version of history lacks the backfilling capability that allows the
return a full DataFrame on the first bar.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-bug">Bug Fixes (BUG)</h2>
<h3 id="adjust-benchmark-events-to-match-market-hours-241">Adjust benchmark events to match market hours (#241)</h3>
<p>Previously benchmark events were emitted at 0:00 on the day the
benchmark related to: in 'minute' emission mode this meant that
the benchmarks were emitted before any intra-day trades were
processed.</p>
<h3 id="ensure-perf-stats-are-generated-for-all-days">Ensure perf stats are generated for all days</h3>
<p>When running with minutely emissions the simulator would report to the
user that it simulated 'n - 1' days (where n is the number of days
specified in the simulation params).  Now the correct number of trading
days are reported as being simulated.</p>
<h3 id="fix-repr-for-cumulative-risk-metrics">Fix repr for cumulative risk metrics.</h3>
<p>The <code>__repr__</code> for RiskMetricsCumulative was referring to an older structure of
the class, causing an exception when printed.</p>
<p>Also, now prints the last values in the metrics DataFrame.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-minute-emission-from-crashing-at-end-of-available-data">Prevent minute emission from crashing at end of available data.</h3>
<p>The next day calculation was causing an error when a minute emission algorithm
reached the end of available data.</p>
<p>Instead of a generic exception when available data is reached, raise and catch a
named exception so that the tradesimulation loop can skip over, since the next
market close is not needed at the end.</p>
<h3 id="fix-pandas-indexing-in-trading-calendar">Fix pandas indexing in trading calendar.</h3>
<p>This could alternatively be filed under PERF. Index using loc instead of the
inefficient index-ing of day, then time.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-crash-in-vwap-transform-due-to-non-existent-member">Prevent crash in vwap transform due to non-existent member.</h3>
<p>The WrongDataForTransform was referencing a <code>self.fields</code> member,
which did not exist.</p>
<p>Add a self.fields member set to <code>price</code> and <code>volume</code> and use
it to iterate over during the check.</p>
<h3 id="fix-max-drawdown-calculation">Fix max drawdown calculation.</h3>
<p>The input into max drawdown was incorrect, causing the bad results.  i.e. the
<code>compounded_log_returns</code> were not values representative of the algorithms total
return at a given time, though <code>calculate_max_drawdown</code> was treating the values
as if they were.  Instead, the <code>algorithm_period_returns</code> series is now used,
which does provide the total return.</p>
<h3 id="fix-cost-basis-calculation">Fix cost basis calculation.</h3>
<p>Cost basis calculation now takes direction of txn into account.</p>
<p>Closing a long position or covering a short shouldn't affect the cost basis.</p>
<h3 id="fix-floating-point-error-in-order">Fix floating point error in order()</h3>
<p>Where order amounts that were near an integer could accidentally be floored or
ceilinged (depending on being postive or negative) to the wrong integer.</p>
<p>e.g. an amount stored internally as -27.99999 was converted to -27 instead of
-28.</p>
<h3 id="update-perf-period-state-when-positions-are-changed-by-splits">Update perf period state when positions are changed by splits</h3>
<p>Otherwise, <code>self._position_amounts</code> will be out of sync with position.amount,
etc.</p>
<h3 id="fix-misalignment-of-downside-series-calc-when-using-exact-dates">Fix misalignment of downside series calc when using exact dates.</h3>
<p>An oddity that was exposed while working on making the return series passed to
the risk module more exact, the series comparison between the returns and mean
returns was unbalanced, because the mean returns were not masked down to the
downside data points; however, in most, if not all cases this was papered over
by the call to <code>.valid()</code> which was removed in this change set.</p>
<h3 id="check-that-selflogger-exists-before-using-it">Check that self.logger exists before using it.</h3>
<p><code>self.logger</code> is initialized as <code>None</code> and there is no guarantee that users have
set it, so check that it exists before trying to pass messages to it.</p>
<h3 id="prevent-out-of-sync-market-closes-in-performance-tracker">Prevent out of sync market closes in performance tracker.</h3>
<p>In situations where the performance tracker has been reset or patched to handle
state juggling with warming up live data, the <code>market_close</code> member of the
performance tracker could end up out of sync with the current algo time as
determined by the</p>
<p>The symptom was dividends never triggering, because the end of day checks would
not match the current time.</p>
<p>Fix by having the tradesimulation loop be responsible, in minute/minute mode,
for advancing the market close and passing that value to the performance
tracker, instead of having the market close advanced by the performance tracker
as well.</p>
<h3 id="fix-numerous-cumulative-and-period-risk-calculations">Fix numerous cumulative and period risk calculations.</h3>
<p>The calculations that are expected to change are:
-   cumulative.beta
-   cumulative.alpha
-   cumulative.information
-   cumulative.sharpe
-   period.sortino</p>
<h4 id="how-risk-calculations-are-changing">How Risk Calculations Are Changing</h4>
<h5 id="risk-fixes-for-both-period-and-cumulative">Risk Fixes for Both Period and Cumulative</h5>
<h6 id="downside-risk">Downside Risk</h6>
<p>Use sample instead of population for standard deviation.</p>
<p>Add a rounding factor, so that if the two values are close for a given dt, that
they do not count as a downside value, which would throw off the denominator of
the standard deviation of the downside diffs.</p>
<h6 id="standard-deviation-type">Standard Deviation Type</h6>
<p>Across the board the standard deviation has been standardized to using a
'sample' calculation, whereas before cumulative risk was mostly using
'population'. Using <code>ddof=1</code> with <code>np.std</code> calculates as if the values are a
sample.</p>
<h5 id="cumulative-risk-fixes">Cumulative Risk Fixes</h5>
<h6 id="beta">Beta</h6>
<p>Use the daily algorithm returns and benchmarks instead of annualized mean
returns.</p>
<h6 id="volatility">Volatility</h6>
<p>Use sample instead of population with standard deviation.</p>
<p>The volatility is an input to other calculations so this change affects Sharpe
and Information ratio calculations.</p>
<h6 id="information-ratio">Information Ratio</h6>
<p>The benchmark returns input is changed from annualized benchmark returns to the
annualized mean returns.</p>
<h6 id="alpha">Alpha</h6>
<p>The benchmark returns input is changed from annualized benchmark returns to the
annualized mean returns.</p>
<h5 id="period-risk-fixes">Period Risk Fixes</h5>
<h6 id="sortino">Sortino</h6>
<p>Now uses the downside risk of the daily return vs. the mean algorithm returns
for the minimum acceptable return instead of the treasury return.</p>
<p>The above required adding the calculation of the mean algorithm returns for
period risk.</p>
<p>Also, uses <code>algorithm_period_returns</code> and <code>tresaury_period_return</code> as the
cumulative Sortino does, instead of using algorithm returns for both inputs into
the Sortino calculation.</p>
<h2 id="performance-perf">Performance (PERF)</h2>
<h3 id="removed-alias_dt-transform-in-favor-of-property-on-siddata">Removed <code>alias_dt</code> transform in favor of property on SIDData.</h3>
<p>Adding a copy of the Event's dt field as datetime via the <code>alias_dt</code> generator,
so that the API was forgiving and allowed both datetime and dt on a SIDData
object, was creating noticeable overhead, even on an noop algorithms.</p>
<p>Instead of incurring the cost of copying the datetime value and assigning it
to the Event object on every event that is passed through the system, add a
property to SIDData which acts as an alias <code>datetime</code> to <code>dt</code>.</p>
<p>Eventually support for <code>data['foo'].datetime</code> may be removed, and could be
considered deprecated.</p>
<h3 id="remove-the-drop-of-null-return-from-cumulative-returns">Remove the drop of 'null return' from cumulative returns.</h3>
<p>The check of existence of the null return key, and the drop of said return
on every single bar was adding unneeded CPU time when an algorithm was run
with minute emissions.</p>
<p>Instead, add the 0.0 return with an index of the trading day before the
start date.</p>
<p>The removal of the <code>null return</code> was mainly in place so that the period
calculation was not crashing on a non-date index value; with the index as a
date, the period return can also approximate volatility (even though the
that volatility has high noise-to-signal strength because it uses only two
values as an input.)</p>
<h2 id="maintenance-and-refactorings-maint">Maintenance and Refactorings (MAINT)</h2>
<h3 id="allow-sim_params-to-provide-data-frequency-for-the-algorithm">Allow <code>sim_params</code> to provide data frequency for the algorithm.</h3>
<p>In the case that <code>data_frequency</code> of the algorithm is None, allow the
<code>sim_params</code> to provide the <code>data_frequency</code>.</p>
<p>Also, defer to the algorithms data frequency, if provided.</p>
<h2 id="build-bld">Build (BLD)</h2>
<h3 id="added-support-for-building-and-releasing-via-conda">Added support for building and releasing via conda</h3>
<p>For those who prefer building with <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/">http://conda.pydata.org/</a> to compiling
locally with pip.</p>
