"""
Ziplines are composed of multiple components connected by asynchronous
messaging. All ziplines follow a general topology of parallel sources,
datetimestamp serialization, parallel transformations, and finally sinks.
Furthermore, many ziplines have common needs. For example, all trade
simulations require a
:py:class:`~zipline.finance.trading.TradeSimulationClient`.

To establish best practices and minimize code replication, the lines module
provides complete zipline topologies. You can extend any zipline without
the need to extend the class. Simply instantiate any additional components
that you would like included in the zipline, and add them to the zipline
before invoking simulate.


        Here is a diagram of the SimulatedTrading zipline:
